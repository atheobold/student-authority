.pull-left[
*Intellectual Authority* 

- Ideas are evaluated as high quality
- Gains and maintains conversational floor without interruption
- Are spatially attended to
]

--

.pull-right[
*Directive Authority*

- Ability to issue directives to peers
- Authority to manage group dynamics

.larger[Why is student authority important?]

--

Learning in classrooms goes beyond understanding new concepts. 

--

Students also learn who they are and what they can and cannot do. 

<!-- Students’ identities are “dynamically negotiated,” representing a synthesis of -->
<!-- who they are and who they have learned to be through interactions with others.  -->

--

These identities / beliefs largely determine what students' participation in the
classroom looks like.

.pull-left[
 Terri enacted the identity of the mathematical expert.

- Speaking with authority 
- Taking a position of superiority
<!-- Requesting information from Bonnie -->
- Controlling the group's activity and the uptake of ideas
<!-- Of 15 instances, 13 Terri controlled  -->
- Inserting Bonnie to save face
<!-- Telling her to raise her hand when they weren't done -->
]

--

.pull-right[
Bonnie enacted the identity of mathematically helpless. 

- Requesting information
<!-- Twice as often as Terri -->
- Rarely asked questions or initiated solutions
- Positions herself as "dumb"

considered a type of microaggression.*** (Gholson & Martin, 2019)]
</center>

--

- Not every microinvalidation experienced by as student rises to the form of 
oppression

- For some groups and in many contexts, the structures that shape a discipline 
in the classroom can create feelings of oppression.
